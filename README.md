# Image-Generation-Using-GAN-with-CIFAR-10-Dataset
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset to generate images of objects like cars, airplanes, trees, etc. The project uses TensorFlow for building the GAN architecture and Streamlit for providing a user-friendly interface.
